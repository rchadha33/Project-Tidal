## A web app revolutionizing energy economics with geospatial computation and analytics, forecasting tidal power as a key to curbing rising energy costs and emissions.

> The government, corporations, and renewable energy enthusiasts all are able to make use of our application as it provides real-time data on the amount of renewable energy that can be produced at numerous locations around the world. Not only can users navigate our application's global map with fluidity, but they will be able to pinpoint locations with the potential for greater renewable energy production than others. Additionally, users are provided with the current amount of CO2 emission outputs across different countries as well as the amount that can be avoided at each location if renewable energy practices are utilized.

# Tech Stack Involved:
> Node.js
> AWS (Real Time Data) 
    > S3
    > Lambda
> Mapbox.JS
> HTML/CSS/JavaScript
> Node.JS
> Intel Cloud Platform (Compute Instances and EDA) 
> Python (Data Scraping & Automation of Geo-Spacial Data with BeautifulSoup4, Numpy, Pandas)

# Who is this project for?

> We hope for users interested in insights towards the financial dwellings of Energy Consumptions, Emmissions and Lifecycle will find this platform not just insightful but actionable. Tidal Energy is a sparsely researched field that we believe would be beneficial to a number of geographies, organizations and govt. entities ; especially in a time of soaring energy usage + prices.


 # Enjoy!
